    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Deliciously anise-y biscotti, with a lot of crunch and a bit of lemon.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 TBSP lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 TBSP anise seed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Move oven rack to upper-middle position and pre-heat to 350 degrees</li>
        <li>Sift first three ingredients into small bowl</li>
        <li>whisk sugar and eggs into large bowl until combined. Stir in final three ingredients. Sift the dry ingredients over the mixture and fold until just combined</li>
        <li>Cover cookie sheet with parchment paper and lightly oil. Divide dough into halves and place each half on paper. Using floured hands, roll each half into a log measuring approx. 13"x2" and place them 3" apart.
            Lightly pat down each half until they roughly double in width</li>
        <li>Bake, turning pan once, until golden brown and lightly cracking on top, approx. 35 minutes</li>
        <li>Cool loaves for 10 minutes. Cut each loaf on the diagonal into 3/8" slices with a serrated bread knife and space pieces on the cookie sheet, laying them on their side. 
            Return to oven until crisp and brown on both sides, approx. 15 minutes, ensuring you remove and flip the cookies halfway through baking. Transfer to wire rack and cool completely</li>
    </ol>
